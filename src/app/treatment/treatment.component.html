              <h1>TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS</h1>
              <p>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat
                  COVID-2019.
                  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness
                  should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
              <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the
                  symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from
                  other
                  people, until you have recovered.</p>
